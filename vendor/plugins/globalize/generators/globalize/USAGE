Description:
    Generates a new migration that creates and populates the "globalize" db tables.
    All tables are prefixed with "globalize_", so they won't conflict with 
    other application tables. Run 'rake migrate' afterwards to synch the db.

Example:
    ./script/generate globalize

    This will create:
	db/migrate/xxx_globalize.rb
